# Blazor Overview

**Blazor** is a modern web framework developed by Microsoft that allows developers to build interactive web applications using C# and .NET instead of JavaScript. It leverages WebAssembly to enable C# code to run directly in the browser, providing a full-stack development experience with a single language.

## Key Features of Blazor

1. **Component-Based Architecture**:
   - Blazor applications are built using reusable components that encapsulate UI, logic, and data binding, making it easier to manage complex UIs.

2. **Two Hosting Models**:
   - **Blazor Server**: Runs on the server and interacts with the client via SignalR, suitable for applications needing minimal client-side processing.
   - **Blazor WebAssembly (WASM)**: Runs entirely in the browser using WebAssembly, allowing for rich client-side interactions.

3. **Full-Stack Development with C#**:
   - Use C# across the stack, sharing code between client and server, eliminating the need for multiple programming languages.

4. **Rich User Interfaces**:
   - Supports HTML and CSS, enabling the creation of dynamic and responsive UIs with familiar web technologies.

5. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Built-in support for dependency injection (DI) simplifies the management of service lifetimes and dependencies.

6. **Routing**:
   - Provides a routing mechanism to define routes for components, enabling navigation within the application.

7. **Data Binding**:
   - Supports one-way and two-way data binding for synchronizing UI elements with data models.

8. **Integration with JavaScript**:
   - Allows interoperability with JavaScript libraries, providing flexibility in leveraging existing JavaScript resources.

## Important Terminologies

- **Component**: A self-contained unit of UI that can include markup, logic, and styles. Components can be nested and reused.
  
- **@page Directive**: Specifies that a component should be treated as a page with a specific route.
  ```razor
  @page "/counter"
